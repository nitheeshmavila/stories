               <p>By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.</p>
